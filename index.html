In rare public comments about her personal life, Michelle Obama, the former first lady, reminded people of this in a recent podcast interview. In rare public comments about her personal life, she discussed swirling rumors that she and her husband, former President 
        Barack Obama, were headed for divorce, and tacitly explained why she didn’t attend President Trump’s inauguration.
    The gossip about a possible split was fueled by Mrs. Obama’s absence from two major public events in January that her husband attended: 
        former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral and President Trump’s inauguration.
    <h2>GOOD NEWS</h2> 
        WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department has moved to drop a criminal case against the alleged East Coast leader of the MS-13 gang less two weeks after he was charged, saying they plan to deport him instead of prosecuting him in the U.S.
        In an unusual move, his lawyer is now fighting prosecutors’ request to immediately dismiss the case, 
        contending he’s in danger of being swiftly deported without due process and sent to an El Salvador prison.
    <h2>EXTRA</h2>
        The late March arrest of Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos in the suburbs outside of Washington was loudly celebrated by the Trump administration as a major
